# Writting-sample
This repository contains a writting sample supported with data of Peru's politics (2001-2022)

+ The article "Representation or Governance: Peru at Crossroads" descriptively analyzes the composition of Congress, the government's winning coalition, and Minister rotation between 2001 and 2022.
+ A key finding is that as the official winning coalition decreases at Congress, Minister rotation increases, similar to the President's chances of being ceased by Congress. 
+ Because Congress can oust the President from office with at least 66% of votes, the government getting around 34% of seats in Congress is critical to preserve moderated political equilibrium. However, electoral rules do not promote centralized government power but a broad, politically fractionated representation in Congress.
+ I wrote the article in March 2022 in collaboration with Sahila Kudalkar and Khristel Zavaleta. In addition to writing the essay, I was responsible for getting, processing, analyzing, and plotting the data.
+ The article's content is in the Representation_or_governance_Peru.pdf file. Please check the Writing-sample-plots.pdf to review the coding work on plots.
